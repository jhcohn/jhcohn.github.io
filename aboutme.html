                                    <p>Hi, I'm Jonathan! I'm an astrophyscist working at Dartmouth College with Ryan Hickox. Outside of astronomy, I am a lapsed violinist and former figure skater. Read on to learn more about me!</p>

									<h2>Gender and sexuality<span class="image left"><img src="images/pride.jpg" alt="Picture of Taylor Hutchison (left) and Jonathan (right) at a Pride event in 2022." /><figcaption style="font-size:14px ; "><a href="https://aibhleog.github.io/" target="blank">Taylor Hutchison</a> (left) and Jonathan (right) at a Pride event in College Station, TX, in 2022.</figcaption></span></h2>
                                    <p>I identify as agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, and broadly as non-binary. For me, this just means not fitting into the binary of "male" or "female." The idea of gender being a perfect binary is a <url><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender" target="_blank">social construct</a> rather than an intrinsic universal truth, and I don't think either "male" or "female" is a good match for me and how I express myself. I don't use just one set of pronouns: you can describe me using "he," "she," and/or "they." I recommend switching it up whenever you're talking about me, instead of just sticking to one!</p>
                                    <p>In addition to gender, sex and sexuality also exist as spectra, rather than binaries. I identify as being somewhere on the spectrum of pansexual.</p>
                                    <p>It took a while for me to understand my gender identity and sexuality, and I'm still learning! It's important for me to be open about my identity, especially since I have encountered very few openly gender-diverse people in positions of power in academia. I hope to show other young queer scientists that they can succeed in astronomy, too.</p>

									<h2>Violin</h2>
									<p>Music has always been very important to me. I took lessons in the Suzuki method from ages 3-15, performing in violin school concerts, public school orchestras, and a Saint Louis youth orchestra. I haven't taken lessons since I was 15 years old, but I have practiced sporadaically ever since. My repertoire includes classical music as well as traditional Celtic, American fiddle, and some pop.</p>

									<h2>Figure skating<span class="image right"><img src="images/kelsey_jonathan.jpg" alt="Picture of Jonathan (left) and Kelsey Barnes (right) ice dancing." /><figcaption style="font-size:14px ; ">Kelsey Barnes (right) and Jonathan (left) competing in Tango at the 2009 Lake Placid Ice Dance Championships.</figcaption></span></h2>
                                    <p>I trained as a figure skater from ages 6-17, competing in local and nationwide competitions. After a knee injury at 13 years old, I stopped competing in freestyle, but continued competing in ice dancing. When I was 14 years old, I moved to a training center for ice dancing in Dallas, TX, living with host families in the greater Dallas area.</p>
                                    <p>I am a U.S. Figure Skating <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/skate/test-structure" target="_blank">Gold Medalist</a> in Ice Dancing and Moves in the Field, and I competed at the <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/skate/test-structure/figure-skating-levels" target="_blank">Novice level</a> in ice dancing. After my final figure skating season was shortened due to another injury, I quit skating to focus on starting college as a physics major at The University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

                                    <h2>Misc</h2>
                                    <p>In my free time, I love reading (mostly fiction, but some nonfiction). Some of my favorite authors right now are RF Kuang, CL Clark, NK Jemisin, Tasha Suri, Clint Smith, Octavia Butler, Ursula K Le Guin, and Indra Das. I'm also an avid writer, including short stories, novels, poetry, and <a href="https://mythmystgames.itch.io/" target="_blank">roleplaying games</a>.
                                    <p>I love running around outside, rock climbing, playing tabletop games and RPGs, watching soccer, and listening to all sorts of music.</p>
