                                    <p>Hi, I'm Jonathan! I'm an astrophyscist working at Texas A&amp;M University with Jonelle Walsh. Outside of astronomy, I am a lapsed violinist and former figure skater. Read on to learn more about me!</p>

									<h2>Genderfluid<span class="image right"><img src="images/genderfluid_flag.png" alt="Image of the genderfluid flag." /></span></h2>
                                    <p>I am genderfluid! I also identify as agender. For me, this means not quite fitting into the typical gender binary of "male" or "female." Sometimes I feel more masculine, sometimes I feel more feminine, and often I don't think either is a good match for me. I don't use just one set of pronouns: you can describe me using "he," "she," or "they." I recommend switching it up whenever you're talking about me, instead of just sticking to one.</p>
                                    <p>It took a while for me to understand my gender identity, and I'm still figuring things out! It's important for me to be open about my identity, especially since I have encountered very few openly gender-diverse people in positions of power in academia. I hope to show other young gender-diverse scientists that they can succeed in astronomy, too.</p>

									<h2>Violin</h2>
									<p>Music has always been very important to me. I trained in the Suzuki method from ages 3-15, performing in violin school concerts, public school orchestras, and a Saint Louis youth orchestra. I haven't taken lessons since I was 15 years old, but I have practiced sporadaically ever since. My repertoire includes classical music as well as traditional Celtic, American fiddle, and some pop.</p>

									<h2>Figure skating</h2>
                                    <p>I trained as a figure skater from ages 6-17, competing in local and nationwide competitions. After a knee injury at 13 years old, I stopped competing in freestyle, but continued competing in ice skating.</p>
                                    <p>I am a U.S. Figure Skating Gold Medalist in Ice Dancing and Moves in the Field. I competed at the Novice level in ice dancing. After my final figure skating season was shortened due to another injury, I quit skating to focus on finishing high school and starting college.</p>

                                    <h2>Misc</h2>
                                    <p>In my free time, I love reading (mostly fiction, but some nonfiction). Some of my favorite authors right now are NK Jemisin, Neil Gaiman, Tasha Suri, Clint Smith, Octavia Butler, Ursula K Le Guin, RF Kuang, and Indra Das. I'm also an avid writer, including short stories, novels, poetry, and for <a href="https://mythmystgames.itch.io/" target="_blank">roleplaying games</a>.
                                    <p>I love running around outside, playing tabletop games and RPGs, watching soccer, and listening to all sorts of music.</p>
