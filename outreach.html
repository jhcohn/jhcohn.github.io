									<h2>Astronomy on Tap, BCS<span class="image right"><img src="images/aot-11-oct-2018_orig.png" alt="An image of Jonathan presenting an Astronomy on Tap talk in 2018." /></span></h2>
                                    <p><a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/" target="_blank" class="label">Astronomy on Tap BCS</a> is a chapter of <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/" target="_blank">Astronomy on Tap (AoT)</a>, located in Bryan, Texas. AoT is a series of free, public science presentations hosted by astronomers, typically at bars. Alongside several astronomy graduate students at Texas A&amp;M, I co-founded the BCS chapter in Spring 2018, and we have held monthly events ever since! I served as an organizer, host, panelist, trivia author, and an occasional speaker at our events, until I moved away from Texas in 2023. Events are currently hosted at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/101bcs/?hl=en" target="_blank">the 101</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Previously, we held events at Revolution Cafe and Bar and the Grand Stafford Theater in Bryan. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we started livestreaming our events on youtube at <a href="https://tx.ag/aotlive" target="_blank">tx.ag/aotlive</a>. You can watch our past events <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@astronomyontapbcs2946/streams" target="_blank">here</a> and subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUI7xJ8e8o-AgZXL-f8ciYw" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>! One of my talks, where I discuss space exploration &mdash; including both the science and ethics of exploration &mdash; is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDYqKRnGwu4" target="_blank">here</a>! You can also follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoTBCS/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AoT_BCS" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aot_bcs/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for up-to-date news on upcoming events!</p>

									<h2>Discover, Explore, and Enjoy Physics and Engineering (DEEP)<span class="image left"><img src="images/festival.jpg" alt="An image of Jonathan presenting the Solar System Walk at the Physics Festival." /></span></h2>
                                    <p><a href="https://physics.tamu.edu/outreach/deep/" target="_blank" class="label">Discover, Explore and Enjoy Physics and Engineering (DEEP)</a> is an outreach, mentorship, and demonstration-building organization at Texas A&amp;M. I served as a graduate student mentor in DEEP for four years, from 2017&ndash;2021.
                                    <p>As a mentor, I worked with a small group of undergraduate students, helping them create, build, and repair astronomy, physics, and engineering demonstrations. These demonstrations are displayed to the public in <a href="https://physicsshow.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">physics shows</a> throughout the year and are also often used in undergraduate courses. DEEP graduate and undergraduate students also display their demos in other outreach events hosted on campus and in the Bryan/College Station community throughout the year.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, DEEP mentors and students help host the annual <a href="https://physicsfestival.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Physics &amp; Engineering Festival</a> every April, during which thousands of people from across the United States visit Texas A&amp;M to see hundreds of demos. In 2021, due to the COVID pandemic, I helped host the first ever virtual Physics Festival over Zoom.</p>

                                    <h2>Letters to a Pre-Scientist</h2>
                                    <p><a href="http://www.prescientist.org/" target="_blank" class="label">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> is a volunteer organization consisting of current scientists at all career levels who serve as pen pals to students in the 5th to 10th grade. The students are paired with their scientist pen pal based on interests. During the ensuing school year, the pen pals each write 4 letters to each other. The goals of the program include de-mystifying Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers, helping students realize that scientists are normal people like themselves, and inspiring students to consider careers in STEM. The program specifically reaches out to low-income communities with the goal of helping open doors into STEM for historically-excluded students.</p>
